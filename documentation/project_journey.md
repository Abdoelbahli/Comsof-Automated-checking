# Comsof Automated Checking System - Project Journey

## What We've Done So Far (Phase 1)

### Initial Python Script
- Created automated checks for fiber optic design validation
- Implemented core validation rules for:
  - Cable connections
  - Closure placements
  - Network architecture
  - Equipment specifications
- Developed command-line interface for engineers

### Web Application Development
- Built Flask backend to handle validation requests
- Created React frontend for web interface
- Added file upload functionality
- Implemented basic results display

## What We're Doing Now (Current Phase)

### Improving Results Visualization
- Restructuring how validation results are formatted
- Moving from text-based to structured data output
- Preparing for better visual presentation
- Adding proper error handling

### Main Tasks in Progress
1. Updating backend functions to return structured data
2. Creating new frontend components for better visualization
3. Improving error messages and warnings
4. Adding progress indicators for long operations

## What We'll Do Next (Future Phases)

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. Complete the visualization improvements
   - Add tables for structured data
   - Implement status indicators
   - Create summary views

2. Enhance User Experience
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Make results easier to understand

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 Months)
1. Add New Features
   - Export results to PDF
   - Save validation history
   - Compare different validations

2. Improve Performance
   - Optimize large file handling
   - Speed up validation checks
   - Add batch processing

### Long-term Vision (3+ Months)
1. Advanced Features
   - Automated fix suggestions
   - Custom validation rules
   - Integration with other tools

2. Reporting and Analytics
   - Trend analysis
   - Statistical reporting
   - Custom report generation
